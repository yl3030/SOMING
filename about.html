            <span>Make your Life more Colorful.</span>
            <p>SOMINGS was established in London, England in 2018 and later relocated its headquarters to Fukuoka City, Japan in order to better focus on meeting the needs of the Asian market. SOMINGS has always advocated that cycling should be liberating, no matter if you are a professional cycler or simply pedaling for fun. The more complex the world, the more people desire simplicity, and the same applies to cycling. SOMINGS as a brand embodies this by producing bikes that look great, are designed well and require little maintenance. The colour scheme presents a unique style and enables cyclists to show off their personal style on each ride!</p>

                The joy of riding is tied to interactions with the environment and the pleasure of pedaling the right bike. We believe SOMINGS bikes are great bikes for commuting and can help people exercise and improve their lifestyle while reducing their carbon footprint. Along the way, the SOMINGS team created an Earth-friendly manufacturing process. This process reduces waste while using locally recyclable materials and maintaining strong environmental protections.

            <h2 class="title-common">ABOUT RIKULAU</h2>
            <p>RIKULAU means “clouded leopard” in the Drekay language that is spoken by indigenous people in Taiwan. Legend has it that the Taiwanese clouded leopard is the ancestral spirit of the Drekay tribe and that the animals led tribal members to climb over the mountains and find a peaceful land. The boutique bicycle brand RIKULAU was created in 2006 with a dream to turn the legendary figure of the clouded leopard into a bicycle. RIKULAU is proud of its manufacturing process and has a world-class reputation for customised top-grade titanium alloy and stainless-steelframes.</p>
