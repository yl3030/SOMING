                The joy of riding originates from interactions with the environment, as well as the riding experiences brought by different bicycle models. We believe Somings bikes can help people exercise and improve their lifestyle while reducing their carbon footprint. Along the way, the Somings team created a planet-friendly manufacturing process. This process reduces waste while using locally recyclable materials and practicing environmental protection.
